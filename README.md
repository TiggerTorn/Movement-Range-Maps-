# Movement-Range-Maps-

This coursework analyzes Facebook's Movement Range Maps, a critical dataset for 
understanding human mobility changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, released as part of 
Facebook's "Data for Good" initiative, offers insights into how populations adapted to physical 
distancing measures through two key metrics: "Change in Movement" and "Stay Put". This analysis 
not only delves into these mobility trends but also critically examines the use of differential privacy 
in the dataset. This approach highlights the balance between deriving meaningful insights from large 
datasets and maintaining individual privacy, underscoring the ethical dimensions of data science in 
public health contexts.
